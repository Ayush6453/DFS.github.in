Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at a root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

### Key Characteristics:
- **Approach**: Uses a stack (either explicitly or through recursion).
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) in the worst case for the stack space.

### Applications:
- Pathfinding
- Topological sorting
- Solving puzzles (like mazes)
- Cycle detection in graphs

### Example Steps:
1. Start at the root (or an arbitrary node).
2. Mark the node as visited.
3. Explore each adjacent unvisited node recursively.
4. Backtrack when no unvisited nodes are available.
